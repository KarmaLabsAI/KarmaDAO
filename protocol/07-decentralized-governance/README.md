# Stage 7: Decentralized Governance System

## Overview

The Karma Labs Decentralized Governance System implements sophisticated community-controlled governance with quadratic voting mechanisms. This stage builds robust governance infrastructure enabling true community control while preventing whale dominance.

## Features

### Stage 7.1: KarmaDAO Core Governance
- Governance Contract Architecture with OpenZeppelin Governor framework
- Quadratic Voting Implementation reducing whale dominance
- Proposal Execution System with timelock controller
- Participation Requirements (1M KARMA threshold)
- Anti-Spam and Security controls

### Stage 7.2: Advanced Governance Features
- Treasury Governance Integration
- Protocol Upgrade Governance
- Staking and Rewards System
- Progressive Decentralization

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npm run compile

# Run tests
npm test

# Deploy Stage 7.1
npm run deploy:stage7.1
npm run setup:stage7.1
npm run validate:stage7.1

# Deploy Stage 7.2
npm run deploy:stage7.2

```

## Configuration

### Governance Parameters
- Proposal Threshold: 1,000,000 KARMA
- Quorum Requirement: 5%
- Voting Delay: 1 day
- Voting Period: 7 days
- Execution Delay: 3 days

### Quadratic Voting
- Reduces whale advantage by ~85%
- Minimum stake: 100 KARMA
- Maximum weight: 100,000 KARMA
- Formula: sqrt(stakedAmount) * 0.5

## Integration

This module integrates with:
- Stage 1: KarmaToken for voting power
- Stage 4: Treasury for fund management
- Stage 6: BuybackBurn for tokenomics

## Status

✅ **Ready for Independent Deployment**

All Stage 7 files have been migrated and organized for independent deployment while maintaining integration points with other stages.
