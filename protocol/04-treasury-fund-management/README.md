- **Multi-signature Treasury**: 3-of-5 multisig control with role-based access
- **Automated Allocation**: 30% Marketing, 20% KOL, 30% Development, 20% Buyback
- **Withdrawal Management**: Timelock for large withdrawals (>10% treasury, 7-day delay)
- **Security Controls**: Pausable, reentrancy protection, emergency mechanisms

### üöÄ Advanced Treasury Features (Stage 4.2)
- **Token Distribution**: Community rewards, airdrops, staking incentives
- **External Integration**: Paymaster funding, BuybackBurn support
- **Transparency**: Monthly reports, public tracking, governance funding
- **Advanced Operations**: Multi-currency support, yield strategies, emergency recovery

```

## Contract Details

### Treasury.sol

**Core Functions:**
- `requestWithdrawal(category, amount, recipient, description)` - Request fund withdrawal
- `calculateAllocations(balance)` - Calculate category allocations
- `updateAllocationPercentages(percentages)` - Update allocation split
- `fundPaymaster(amount)` - Fund gasless transaction system
- `fundBuybackBurn(amount)` - Allocate funds for token buyback

**Access Control:**
- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` - Full treasury control
- `ALLOCATION_MANAGER_ROLE` - Manage fund allocations
- `WITHDRAWAL_MANAGER_ROLE` - Process withdrawals
- `MULTISIG_MANAGER_ROLE` - Multi-signature operations

**Security Features:**
- Multi-signature requirements for large operations
- Timelock mechanism for significant withdrawals
- Pausable for emergency situations  
- Reentrancy protection on all fund transfers
- Comprehensive event logging for transparency

### ITreasury.sol

**Interface defining:**
- Fund management operations
- Allocation and withdrawal functions
- Integration with external contracts
- Reporting and transparency methods

## Fund Allocation Strategy

| Category | Percentage | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Marketing | 30% | Brand promotion, user acquisition campaigns |
| KOL | 20% | Key Opinion Leader partnerships and collaborations |
| Development | 30% | Platform development, maintenance, and improvements |
| Buyback | 20% | Token buyback and burn for value accrual |

## Token Distribution (200M KARMA)

| Type | Allocation | Percentage | Duration |
|------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Airdrop | 20M KARMA | 10% | One-time distribution |
| Staking Rewards | 100M KARMA | 50% | 2 years |
| Engagement Incentives | 80M KARMA | 40% | 2 years |

## Integration Points

### Stage Dependencies
- **Stage 1**: Core Token Infrastructure (KarmaToken)
- **Stage 3**: Token Sales Engine (fund collection)

### External Contract Integration
- **Paymaster**: $100K ETH initial funding for gasless transactions
- **BuybackBurn**: 20% treasury allocation for token value accrual
- **Governance**: Community proposal funding mechanism

## Security Considerations

### Multi-Signature Controls
- 3-of-5 multisig requirement for treasury operations
- Role-based access control for different operations
- Time-delayed execution for large withdrawals

### Emergency Mechanisms
- Pausable contract for emergency situations
- Emergency withdrawal capabilities with proper safeguards
- Fund recovery mechanisms with community oversight

### Audit Requirements
- Comprehensive test coverage (>95%)
- Multiple security audits before mainnet deployment
- Bug bounty program for ongoing security assessment

## API Endpoints

### Public Treasury Data
- `GET /api/treasury/balance` - Current treasury balance
- `GET /api/treasury/allocations` - Category allocations
- `GET /api/treasury/reports` - Monthly treasury reports
- `GET /api/treasury/transactions` - Transaction history

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Balance Monitoring
- Low balance alerts (<1000 ETH)
- Critical balance alerts (<500 ETH)
- Category overdraft warnings (>90% spent)

### Transaction Monitoring
- Large withdrawal notifications (>10% treasury)
- High-frequency transaction alerts
- Unusual spending pattern detection

## Gas Optimization

The Treasury system is optimized for gas efficiency:
- Batch operations for multiple transactions
- Efficient storage patterns for large data sets
- Optimized allocation calculations
- Minimal external calls in critical paths

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual function testing with full coverage
- Edge case validation and boundary testing
- Access control and permission verification
- Gas cost validation and optimization testing

### Integration Tests
- Cross-contract interaction workflows
- Multi-step treasury operations
- External contract integration validation
- Economic mechanism testing

### Security Tests
- Reentrancy attack prevention
- Access control bypass attempts
- Economic attack simulations
- Emergency scenario testing

## Upgrade Path

The Treasury system supports controlled upgrades through:
- Governance-controlled upgrade mechanisms
- Proxy pattern implementation for contract upgrades
- Parameter adjustment through community voting
- Emergency upgrade capabilities with timelock
